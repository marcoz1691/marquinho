Currency Conversion

Assume we have the REST API for:
- Adding a new Currency Exchange Rate
- Updating an existing Currency Exchange Rate
- Deleting an existing Currency Exchange Rate
- Retrieving the Currency Exchange Rate for a source currency, a target currency, and a
specific date.


Test Plan: Currency Conversion APIs

Objective:
To verify the functionality of Currency Conversion APIs, including adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving exchange rates, ensuring accurate data processing.

Preconditions:

User must have access to the Currency Conversion module.
The system should contain pre-existing exchange rates for testing updating and deleting functionalities.
Test Environment:
Testing to be conducted in a staging environment.

Test Dependencies:
Existing exchange rate data in the system.

Test Cases:

1. Add a New Currency Exchange Rate:

Test Case 1: Successfully add a new exchange rate with valid input data.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, valid effective start date, valid exchange rate.
Expected Output: The exchange rate is added successfully, and the system returns a success message.

Test Case 2: Attempt to add an exchange rate with missing required fields.
Input: Missing one or more required fields (source currency, target currency, effective start date, exchange rate).
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating the missing fields.

Test Case 3: Attempt to add an exchange rate with an invalid date format.
Input: Invalid date format in the effective start date.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message about the invalid date format.

Test Case 4: Attempt to add an exchange rate with a negative exchange rate value.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, valid effective start date, exchange rate = -0.5.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that the exchange rate value must be non-negative.

Test Case 5: Attempt to add an exchange rate with a duplicate entry.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, valid effective start date, valid exchange rate.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that a duplicate entry for the same source and target currencies already exists.

Test Case 6: Attempt to add an exchange rate with an effective start date in the past.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, effective start date = yesterday, valid exchange rate.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that the effective start date must be in the future or today.

Test Case 7: Attempt to add an exchange rate with a future effective start date but missing target currency.
Input: Valid source currency, missing target currency, effective start date = tomorrow, valid exchange rate.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating the missing target currency.

Test Case 8: Attempt to add an exchange rate with non-existent source and target currencies.
Input: Source currency = "ABC", target currency = "XYZ", valid effective start date, valid exchange rate.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that the source or target currency does not exist.

Test Case 9: Attempt to add an exchange rate with a very high exchange rate value.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, valid effective start date, exchange rate = 999999999.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that the exchange rate value is too high.

Test Case 10: Successfully add an exchange rate with the minimum allowed exchange rate value.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, valid effective start date, exchange rate = 0.
Expected Output: The exchange rate is added successfully with the minimum allowed value, and the system returns a success message.


2. Update an Existing Currency Exchange Rate:

Test Case 11: Successfully update an existing exchange rate with valid input data.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, valid effective start date, valid updated exchange rate.
Expected Output: The exchange rate is updated successfully, and the system returns a success message.

Test Case 12: Attempt to update an exchange rate with an invalid date format.
Input: Invalid date format in the effective start date during the update.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message about the invalid date format.

Test Case 13: Attempt to update a non-existent exchange rate.
Input: Trying to update an exchange rate that does not exist.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that the exchange rate does not exist.



3. Delete an Existing Currency Exchange Rate:

Test Case 14: Successfully delete an existing exchange rate.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, valid effective start date for an existing exchange rate.
Expected Output: The exchange rate is deleted successfully, and the system returns a success message.

Test Case 15: Attempt to delete a non-existent exchange rate.
Input: Trying to delete an exchange rate that does not exist.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that the exchange rate does not exist.



4. Retrieve Currency Exchange Rate for Source Currency, Target Currency, and Specific Date:

Test Case 16: Successfully retrieve the exchange rate for a valid source currency, target currency, and specific date.
Input: Valid source currency, valid target currency, valid specific date.
Expected Output: The system returns the correct exchange rate information for the specified source currency, target currency, and date.

Test Case 17: Attempt to retrieve an exchange rate with missing source currency.
Input: Missing source currency.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating the missing source currency.

Test Case 18: Attempt to retrieve an exchange rate with missing target currency.
Input: Missing target currency.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating the missing target currency.

Test Case 19: Attempt to retrieve an exchange rate with an invalid date format.
Input: Invalid date format in the specific date.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message about the invalid date format.

Test Case 20: Attempt to retrieve an exchange rate with a non-existent source currency.
Input: Non-existent source currency.
Expected Output: The system rejects the request and returns an error message indicating that the source currency does not exist.
